# 🐜 Load Balance Simulator — ACO-Based Memory Allocation

Welcome to the **Load Balance Simulator**, a visual and interactive tool simulating **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** for **dynamic memory allocation** in operating systems. This project showcases how bio-inspired algorithms like ACO can be used for **intelligent task assignment** and **load balancing**.

Built with **Next.js**, **React (TypeScript)**, **TailwindCSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, it offers an intuitive way to understand ACO-driven memory optimization.


## 🧠 Core Concept

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a **metaheuristic inspired by the foraging behavior of ants**, where virtual "ants" traverse a graph of memory blocks to find the most optimal allocation based on:

- 🐜 **Pheromone Trails**: Indicate historical preference and low memory load.
- ⚖️ **Heuristic Value**: Based on memory access speed, usage, and fragmentation.
- 🔁 **Probabilistic Selection**: Ants probabilistically select the next best block using pheromone intensity and heuristics.


## 🧩 Features

- 📊 **Visual ACO Simulation**: Watch ants select optimal memory blocks in real-time.
- 📦 **Dynamic Factors**:
  - Access Frequency
  - Access Speed
  - Memory Usage
  - Fragmentation Level
- 🌐 Built with:
  - `Next.js 13 (App Router)`
  - `TypeScript + TailwindCSS`
  - `shadcn/ui` components (card, slider, tabs, etc.)
